# ParkSmart-Computer-Vision-Parking-Availability-System
A real-time parking occupancy detection system built with OpenCV and Machine Learning (SVM). The project processes parking lot surveillance video, detects whether each parking spot is occupied or vacant, and overlays results directly on the live video feed.

🛠️ # Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib
ML Techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
Computer Vision: Connected components, thresholding, contour detection, resizing
